I just found very amusing story about two great physicists, [James Franck][jamesfranck] (Jew german physicist) and [Max von Laue][maxvonlaue] (non-jew german physicist, but Hitler critic), from the university where I studied ([University of Göttingen][unigoe]). They had to hide their Nobel prize medals at [Niels Bohr’s][neilsbohr] lab in Copenhagen, for not to be confiscated by Nazis. The situation became tricky when Nazi rolled into Copenhagen in 1940, but Niels Bohr and his colleague, [George de Hevesy][dehevesy] managed to hide those medals interestingly _very scientific_ way.

Read the whole story below to find out. :-)

Unfortunately, my university, [hometown/host to 44 Nobel Laureates](http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/a/2002/nobelcd/html/hauptmenue.htm), had seen great exodus of mathematicians, scientists and intellectuals during Nazi period. Though few of them decided to come back from exile, including [Max von Laue][maxvonlaue], who, in the end, got possession of his Nobel Prize Medal. The same story explains it how.
