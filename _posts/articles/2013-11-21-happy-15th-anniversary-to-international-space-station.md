Contrary to many skeptics, projects of massive scale are put into being with the cooperation across the limits of national borders. [International Space Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is definitely the best example of it. It is the largest man-made structure ever-built in Space. It has just become 15 years old and this video shows its wonderful journey, kind of like "Fabulous life of Astronauts on board ISS". ;-)

The whole project did take long to realise. This infographic shows the history of its construction and development.
