The ability of German language, to compound any words creating whole new word which expresses something, which is sometimes seemingly inexpressible, is quite unique among modern well-survived languages (a characteristic, to be seen ancient Indian language, Sanskrit, a language quite obsolete in modern times). That is basically the reason that you may not find some German _compounding_ words in typical German dictionary, but if you know what it is made of (_elementary words_), you can still make out the meaning.

Ben Schott has suggested some new words in his forthcoming book, [Schottenfreude: German Words for the Human Condition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039916670X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=039916670X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=loneimmo-20). The title itself is sort of ambiguous (as a _German compounding word_, literally means _Schott's pleasure_). I learned about this book from recent [NYTimes online article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/12/opinion/international/20131011_Schott.html). Here's the small snippet of it.

If you know some German words, then I wish you _Happy Word-Compounding!_ ;-)
