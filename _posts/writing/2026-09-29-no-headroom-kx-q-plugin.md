I set out to answer a narrow question with an experiment instead of an opinion: **does KX's
official Claude Code plugin for q measurably improve a frontier model's q output?**

The answer, on fifteen paired tasks, is that I could not measure any improvement, and the more
useful finding is *why* I could not. The comparison never got a chance to run. That is a different
and more interesting result than "the plugin doesn't help", and the distance between those two
sentences is most of what this article is about.

## Why this experiment exists at all

I am writing a curriculum that teaches array thinking through q. The original plan included
authoring a q skill for Claude Code. Then I found that KX already ships a family of official
plugins, covering q, PyKX, KDB-X and KDB.AI among others, with their own marketplace and a qlint
integration.

If you do not use Claude Code: a *plugin* there is a package that can bundle *skills*, agents, hooks
and tool servers. A skill is a folder of written guidance that the model loads into its context
when a request looks relevant. It does not change the model; it changes what the model has read
just before it answers. KX's q plugin, at the commit I tested, was two skills: the q guidance
itself, and `qlint-snippet`, which runs KX's linter over a piece of q. The guidance is exactly the
kind this curriculum cares about: write q the way q wants to be written, reach for whole-list
operations instead of loops, avoid the known traps.

Writing a competing general-purpose q skill would be redundant. But the *learning* objective was
never "author a skill"; it was "author and evaluate a skill". Evaluation survives the redundancy
intact. So the deliverable changed from a skill to an independent evaluation of the one that
already exists, with authoring gated behind the eval finding a gap.

Which means this article was always going to publish whatever came back. That commitment was made
in the protocol before any data existed, and it is doing real work now.

## Reading the answers: three q idioms in two minutes

*New to q? It is the language of kdb+, a column-oriented time-series database best known in
finance. [Article 1](https://nandan.me/writing/array-thinking-all-the-way-to-q/) has a one-minute
primer on array languages. This section is the minimum you need to read the answers below.*

The eval scored answers on *idiomaticity* as well as correctness: not just "does it print the right
thing" but "is this how q is meant to be written". What that means is easiest to see in the answers
themselves. All three below are real answers from the eval, and `make verify` runs them.

One task handed the model a `while` loop that built running totals the way most of us learned to:
an index, an accumulator, an output list, and three updates on every pass. Both conditions threw all
of it away and wrote this:

```q
x:5 3 8 1;
show sums x;
```

`sums` is a running total over the whole list, and it prints `5 8 16 17`. The loop spelled out
*how* to walk the list; `sums` names *what* you want from it. The index and the accumulator were
never part of the problem, only of one way of solving it. That move, from steps to a description
of the result, is the reflex the whole curriculum is about.

Counting words, from the baseline's answer:

```q
words:`$(" " vs "the cat sat on the mat the");
show count each group words;
```

q reads right to left. `" " vs` splits the string on spaces, `` `$ `` turns the pieces into
*symbols* (q's interned strings), `group` maps each distinct word to the positions where it occurs,
and `count each` counts each of those position lists: `the` 3, the others 1. There is no dictionary
to fill in and no counter to increment; the count falls straight out of the grouping.

And the database side. q has a SQL-like layer, qSQL, that runs over in-memory tables:

```q
t:([] sym:`AAPL`AAPL`MSFT`AAPL`MSFT; side:`buy`sell`buy`buy`sell)
show select n:count i by sym,side from t
```

`i` is the row number, so `count i` counts the rows in each `sym`/`side` group. It returns a small
keyed table: AAPL buy 2, the other three pairs 1. The imperative instinct here is a loop over rows
that bumps a counter per key. Both conditions wrote this line character for character.

Keep those three in mind. They are what "idiomatic" looked like in this eval, and the model wrote
them without any plugin's help, which is most of the story that follows.

## The design, in brief

**Subject:** `q-knowledge@kx-skills`, pinned at commit `8b7040f` (plugin v0.1.0). There is no version
tag upstream, so the SHA is the pin. What this run actually tested is the q guidance skill.
`qlint-snippet` needs KX's linter installed locally and a shell to run it, and my harness had
neither: in Part B the model invoked it four times and the lint never ran. The plugin's self-checking path is
untested here, and nothing below speaks for it.

> **Dated note, 2026-09-25.** KX has kept shipping since this run. On 14 Aug it bundled a
> documentation-search MCP server into every plugin in the family and bumped `q-knowledge` to 0.1.1;
> it has also added new plugins and Codex support. The q skill's own content is **byte-identical** to
> the pinned commit (I checked the tree hashes). So every number below still describes exactly what I
> tested, but the plugin you install today also searches KX's documentation, and this eval did not
> test that. My harness allowed only `Skill`, `Read` and `Glob` (with one leak, below); a re-run would first
> have to decide whether to let the docs server in.

**Conditions:** A = baseline, no plugin. B = that plugin loaded. Identical prompts, identical
model (`claude-opus-5`), identical settings, with one exception I found only when an adversarial
review re-read the raw logs. In three condition-B sessions (tasks 03, 04 and 06), a claude.ai Google
Drive connector on my account had finished connecting before the session started, and eight of its
tools were listed in the session's context; in their condition-A twins it was still pending, so the
three intended tools were all there was. None of those tools was ever called, and all three pairs
scored identically, so no result turns on it. But those three pairs were not isolated by the plugin
alone, and I should have pinned the connectors off rather than trusting the tool flag.

**Part A: does it fire?** A skill that never activates is worth zero regardless of content.
20 prompts: 10 that should fire, 10 adjacent traps that should not (NumPy vectorization, plain
SQL, BQN trains, `merge_asof` in pandas, "group a JavaScript array by a key").

**Part B: is the output better?** 15 q tasks (translate from Python, write from an English spec,
fix a deliberately unidiomatic solution), each run under both conditions. Correctness by exact
golden-file diff. Idiomaticity as a **five-item binary checklist**, never a 1–5 "feel" score,
because a feel score drifts upward as my own q taste improves while the benchmark stays fixed.
Every checklist item has to be justifiable against a published source, Q for Mortals or
code.kx.com, rather than against my preferences. (One item did not live up to that, and it is the
one that decided the only discordant pair; more below.)

**Decision rule, fixed in advance:** a paired sign test on discordant pairs. Count only the tasks
where the two conditions differ; the effect is real only if one side takes ≥~80% of them. (Strictly, that is a heuristic in the
spirit of a sign test rather than an exact one: a two-sided exact sign test cannot reach 5%
significance with fewer than six discordant pairs, because even 5–0 gives p = 0.0625.)

I want to flag one thing I am *not* claiming. **The scoring was not blinded.** At the time I told
myself it could not be, because idiomatic q gives away its condition. That was wrong: the saved
answers are code only, five pairs turned out identical, and relabelling the thirty files with random
IDs before scoring would have cost minutes. The published-source requirement on every checklist
item is the defence I did use against evaluator drift. It is weaker than blinding, most of all on
the one pair that turned on a judgement call. A blinded rescore of the committed answers is the
cheapest improvement anyone repeating this could make.

## The control that decided whether any of this meant anything

My repository contains `.claude/skills/idiomatic-q/SKILL.md`. It carries anti-loop rules, "prefer
qSQL over row-wise thinking", and the `aj` sort-discipline gotchas. The root `CLAUDE.md` adds more
q guidance. The `lessons/` directory is full of verified idiomatic q.

Run the eval with Claude Code from inside that working copy and **condition A is not a baseline.**
It silently inherits a q idiom skill, which is approximately the thing under test. Both arms get
treated, the comparison measures nothing, and **the results look completely normal.** That is the
part that should scare you. A contaminated null and a clean null are the same numbers.

So every one of the 50 sessions ran from an empty scratch directory outside the repository, with
no `CLAUDE.md` and no `.claude/`, driven headless. I verified it rather than assuming it. The committed
session logs record what each session loaded: every condition-A session had the same 16 skills,
none q-related, no project instructions, and specifically no `idiomatic-q`. Every condition-B
session had the same 16 plus exactly `q-knowledge:q` and `q-knowledge:qlint-snippet`. (When I
asked a session to list its own skills it said 41. A model's account of its context is not a
log, which is this article's point in miniature.)

The general form: **when the environment can leak the treatment into the control, that control is a
property of your harness, not of your analysis.** You cannot add it afterwards, and you cannot
detect its absence from the output.

What the eval did: all 50 sessions ran headless from an empty scratch directory with no CLAUDE.md or .claude; the session logs show condition A loaded 16 skills, none q-related, and condition B the same 16 plus exactly q-knowledge:q and q-knowledge:qlint-snippet.">

## Part A: it fires

**8/10 on should-fire. 9/10 on the traps.**

The two should-fire misses are my instrument's fault, not the plugin's. Both prompts say "fix
*this* q code" and "convert *this* list comprehension", and my table supplies no code. In an empty
directory the model searched for a file, found none, and asked me to paste the snippet. It never
attempted q, so there was nothing for a skill to help with.

I wrote "so really it's 8/8 on the well-formed prompts" in the first draft of this article, and an
adversarial reviewer was right to call it. **Choosing your denominator after you have seen which
items missed is the same overfitting my own protocol forbids** when tuning a skill's trigger
against a test set. I would not have accepted it from the plugin's authors, so I do not get to do
it in my own favour. Two of my twenty items were malformed. The recall this instrument measured is
**8/10**. Repairing those prompts makes a *different* test set, and any number off it has to come
from a fresh run.

The single false positive was "Write a query to fetch users by email", answered entirely in q,
schema and all. Good q; an answer to a question nobody asked in q. Two caveats keep me from making
much of it: my harness deliberately strips all ambient context, so `q-knowledge` was the only
domain skill on the bench, and every trap built to bait a keyword match (`merge_asof`, "group",
J's rank operator) held firm. The mis-fire came from the *least* q-flavoured prompt in the set.

The reason Part A matters is that it forecloses the easy explanation for what comes next. **In Part
B the plugin loaded in 14 of 15 runs.** Whatever follows is a finding about an active plugin.

One methodological note that paid for itself immediately. I decided firing **mechanically** (the
session emitted a `Skill` tool call naming a `q-knowledge` skill, read off the session log) rather
than by judging whether the answer felt q-flavoured. Good thing: one prompt produced fluent,
correct q idioms (`xs where p xs`, `a f' b`) with **no skill loaded at all**, and in Part B one
task matched its plugin-armed twin without ever invoking the plugin. Eyeballing would have scored
both as fires. **If your eval measures activation, measure the tool call.**

## Part B: the ceiling

Generation and scoring were separate sittings: all 30 answers collected and saved verbatim first,
then scored in one pass with both conditions side by side. Scoring an answer right after generating
it means the second condition is read in the light of the first, and the checklist quietly stops
being independent.

Here is what came back.

| | condition A (baseline) | condition B (plugin) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Correctness | 14/15 | 14/15 |
| Idiomaticity | 73/75 | 74/75 |
| **Discordant pairs** | **1** | |
| Wins | 0 | 1 |

An exact two-sided sign test needs at least six discordant pairs, all going one way, before it can
reach 5% significance. I got one.
**The test never engaged.**

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/no-headroom-kx-q-plugin/figure-2-the-ceiling.svg" alt="Fifteen tiles, one per paired task. Five (02, 07, 10, 13, 14) are byte-for-byte identical q in both conditions; eight differ in code but score the same; task 15 is a shared miss, failed identically by both; task 08 is the only discordant pair, decided by one checklist item. Correct 14/15 in both conditions; idiomatic 73/75 without the plugin, 74/75 with it; one discordant pair where an exact two-sided sign test needs at least six, all one way, to reach 5% significance.">
  <figcaption>Figure 2. The ceiling. Fifteen pairs, one disagreement, and that one is a judgement call.</figcaption>
</figure>

And that one pair is thin. It turns entirely on whether writing

```q
t:update notional:price*qty from t
show t
```

instead of

```q
show update notional:price*qty from t
```

counts as an unnecessary binding. Under the rule I fixed *before* scoring (a candidate fails the
"no unnecessary temporaries" item only if it introduces a binding the verified reference solution
does not need), it does. But the task said "add a column `notional` … and show the result", and
mutating the table is a defensible reading of "add". A second scorer could call it a tie without
straining. A margin that flips on one person's reading of one line is not a margin.

Meanwhile **five of the fifteen task pairs came back byte-for-byte identical**, including two you
met above: the `select … by sym,side` and the `sums x` that replaced the `while` loop. Another was
simply `show sums 1 2 3 4 5`.

This is a **ceiling**, and it is the honest headline. The tasks cannot discriminate between the
conditions because baseline `claude-opus-5` already solves them. (Pedantically: my protocol defined
the ceiling case as 15/15 in both arms, and I got 14/15, the one miss being the same task in both
arms: correct join, failed on an extra output line. Substance yes, letter no. Pre-registering your
degenerate cases is worth nothing if you then gesture at them approximately.)

## The mistake I made, stated plainly

I wrote fifteen tasks that were easy to *verify*. Every one has a reference solution that runs and
a golden output that diffs. That discipline is what makes the eval trustworthy, and the way I got
it is what broke the eval: **I kept verification simple by choosing simple tasks, and simple tasks
left no headroom.** "Sum of squares." "Total qty by sym." A frontier model in 2026 does not need
help with these from anyone. Exact-output checking does not require easy tasks; I just did not
write any hard ones.

The fix costs an hour and I did not spend it: **run the baseline arm alone first, and check that it
fails often enough to leave room for the treatment to show.** Fifteen sessions would have told me
this task set had no headroom, before I spent fifty on a comparison that could not resolve.

So the result I am publishing is not "the plugin doesn't help". It is **"this instrument could not
have detected a small effect, and detected no large one."** Those differ, and only the second is
something I earned. The first would be the cleaner sentence, which is precisely why I have to
resist writing it.

## What did separate the conditions

The tasks could not discriminate on quality. They discriminated cleanly on cost.

| | A | B | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total output tokens, 15 tasks | 3,671 | 10,337 | **2.8×** |
| Median per-task ratio | | | **3.9×** |
| Widest single task | 23 | 407 | **17.7×** |

Roughly three times the output tokens, for code that scored identically on fourteen of fifteen
tasks and was *literally the same code* on five of them. When your primary metric hits a ceiling,
the secondary metrics are the finding.

</figure>

## The one genuinely interesting finding, which turned out to be mine, not theirs

Task 15 is about the *as-of join*: for each trade, find the most recent quote at or before the
trade's time. q's `aj` does this in one call, and it assumes the quote table is sorted by time
within each symbol; when it is not, `aj` can return the wrong quote without complaint (lesson 04 of
the curriculum shows it happening, with verified output). The task handed the model a join over an
unsorted quote table, said it was returning wrong quotes, and asked for a fix and *the appropriate
in-memory attribute*. An attribute is a flag you put on a column to promise q something about how its values
are laid out: `` `g# `` (grouped) has q keep an index from each distinct value to the rows that hold it;
`` `p# `` (parted) promises that equal values sit together in contiguous runs. (The as-of join gets its own article, the next in this series.)

The premise was false, and I did not know until the last adversarial review ran the task's own code
on the pinned build: with this particular data, the unsorted join returns the right rows anyway.
Task 15 never contained the bug it described. Both models were asked to repair a join that worked,
did what the prompt said, and could not have been credited for spotting a bug that was not there.
Nothing in the scores moves (both arms missed this task for an unrelated reason, an extra output
line), but the instrument is wrong in a second way, and the fix is the discipline this repo applies
to everything else: **a task that claims a bug must be run and shown to fail before it is used.** I
checked that my reference *passed*. That is not the same check.

Both conditions sorted the table, produced the correct joined table, and applied `` `p# `` where
my task sheet cites `` `g# ``.

**I first wrote this section up as a finding, and I had it wrong.** The draft said both arms had
reached for "the disk attribute on an in-memory table", citing [the `aj`
page](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/aj/), which frames the pair as memory → `` `g# ``, disk →
`` `p# ``. Then the sibling page: [set-attribute](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/set-attribute/) says
parted applies in memory as well as on disk, whenever the data can be sorted so that it can be set.
Both candidates sorted the table first. That is precisely the precondition. `` `p# `` there is
defensible.

The part that stings: **my own repository already contained that correction.** A licensing-and-docs
audit I ran back at milestone one recorded, in writing, that `p#` "also works in memory … It is not useless in memory." I
scored the eval only days later, cited the `aj` page, and never opened either the sibling page or my own notes on exactly
this claim.

So the honest version of this section is much smaller than the one I wanted to write. There is no
"KX's plugin failed to correct a deviation from KX's own guidance." There is: both arms diverged
from *my* task sheet, in a direction the documentation supports, and **my task sheet is the thing
that was too narrow.** It names one attribute as though it were the only right answer.

I have left the score at zero, because the scoring rule was fixed before the pass and gets applied
consistently or it is not a rule. As a sensitivity check: scored as the documentation supports,
idiomaticity would be 74/75 without the plugin and 75/75 with it: still one discordant pair, still
no verdict. But the interpretation is retracted, and since both arms diverged
identically it never touched the comparison anyway.

That is also the end of the one candidate "gap" this eval produced. My protocol permits authoring a
skill only if the eval exposes a gap the plugin does not fill; what it actually exposed was a defect
in my own instrument. No skill, then — and a sharper task set goes in the notebook.

## What I would tell you to steal

- **Establish your baseline's failure rate before designing the comparison.** Otherwise you build
  an instrument with no headroom and find out fifty sessions later.
- **Measure activation as a tool call, not a vibe.** Fluent domain output is not evidence that a
  domain skill loaded.
- **Build the harness so it cannot leak the treatment into the control**, and verify that by
  asking, not by assuming. A contaminated null is indistinguishable from a clean one.
- **Smoke-test the treatment arm's happy path specifically.** My first run had condition B's reads
  of its own bundled reference files being permission-denied. The harness was handicapping the
  plugin against its own design. A harness bug that weakens the treatment reads as a null result.
- **Write down the taste-dependent scoring rules before the scoring pass, and anchor them to an
  artifact.** "No unnecessary temporaries" is pure preference until you tie it to something; for
  me, the verified reference solution. Doing that first is what turned this run's entire margin
  into a documented caveat instead of a headline.
- **Read the sibling page before you call something a deviation from the docs.** My one juicy
  finding evaporated on the second page of the same reference — and my own repo had already written
  the correction down. When a result flatters your thesis, that is the moment to go looking for the
  page that kills it.
- **Publish the null.** It cost the same fifty sessions a positive would have.

## Verdict

No lift, on a task set that could not have shown a small one. KX's `q-knowledge` guidance, as
pinned at `8b7040f`, activates reliably and writes good q (its linter path was not tested). So does the model without it, on tasks
this easy, for about a third of the tokens. No skill authored. The curriculum ships on its own merits.

The eval was underpowered, and that is the finding I actually have. It is worth publishing because
the failure mode generalises far past q: **an A/B against a frontier model is measuring your task
set at least as much as your treatment**, and if you did not check the baseline for headroom first,
a null result is telling you about your benchmark, not about the thing you were testing.
